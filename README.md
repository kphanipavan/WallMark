# WallMark
Basic CPU Benchmarking tool using Python

# Requirements:

● Python 3.6 or above.

● Certain packages for the program to run properly, which will be installed automatically if not found.

● Basic knowledge of CLI.

# Usage:

● Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/kphanipavan/WallMark/releases) page and extract it.

● The downloaded Zip file contains a file *bm.py*.

● Open Command line tool of your choice and [CD into the downloaded Folder](https://www.howtogeek.com/659411/).

● Type the following based on your Operating System.

--Windows--
```cmd
python bm.py
```
--Linux or MacOS--
```bash
python3 bm.py
```

● The program may take some time to initialise.

● You successfully loaded the program if you see the following...

![Still working on this...]()

● From here, you can read the instructions provided in the program.

● *Most* of the input you give to the program are numbers.

# Features:

● To run the benchmark, you have 2 ways of passing the required parameters.

● The first one, *Guided Parameter Entry*, will ask you in detail, what configuration of benchmark you want to run, as shown below:

![Still working on this too...]()

● The second option assumes you have prior knowledge of what parameters are needed, and hence the the input is given as an array, as shown below:

*To be implemented*

● You can save the Benchmark results into an WallMark specific encoded file. The file can be shared over the internet but make sure the file isn't compressed by other programs.

● WallMark has the result file decoder inbuilt and can be accessed via the Main Menu, as shown below:

# Important Notes:

While the Benchmark is running, your CPU heats up significantly and may increase your PC's fan speed. This is normal, make sure you don't have stuff covering the Fan Intake for proper cooling and longevitivity of your PC.

The tool is under heavy production and will be updated regularly.
I am open to suggestions. Help with creating a GUI is appreciable.
